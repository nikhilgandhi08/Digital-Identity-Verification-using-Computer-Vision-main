# Digital Identity Verification using Computer Vision

Digital Identity Verification using OpenCV leverages computer vision techniques to authenticate individuals' identities by analyzing images. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) provides tools to process visual data for task like facial recognition which is a key in identity verification systems.


## Deployment

#### To deploy this project first of all clone this repository in your local disk

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atharvabharambe/Face-Recognizer-using-OpenCV.git
```

#### Follow the below steps to execute the project:

- After cloning the repo open the same folder in **Jupyter Notebook**

- Open the file named `Generating_dataset.ipynb` and run it by pressing **Shift+Enter**. (This will take 200 images of the face detected and store it in 'data' folder)

- To add more than 1 persons images make sure to increment the id by 1 in `Generating_dataset.ipynb` file. (for ex: After adding images of 1st person make sure to make the id = 2 as shown in red box in below image and then run the cell again as mentioned in above step)

- Next Open the `Training.ipynb` file and run every cell (This will train the classifier as per your images and id's) 

- Finally run the file named `Detection.ipynb`

- To terminate the session press ****'Enter'****
